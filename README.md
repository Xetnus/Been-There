# Been There - a Google Maps Utility

Been There is a Chrome extension that tracks which places you've seen on
Google Maps. This extension was created with OSINT investigations in mind,
but can also be used to keep a running log of all of your B2B leads. Phone
numbers, street address, Plus Codes, and place names will all be logged and
can be exported for further analysis.

It's not yet on the Chrome Web Store, but it will be soon.
